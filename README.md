# Printing-Calculator

Write a program that acts as a “printing” calculator. The program takes two inputs from the user:
number
operator

The following operators should be recognized by the program: + − * / S E
The S operator tells the program to set the accumulator to the typed in number. The E operator tells the program that execution is to end. The arithmetic operations are performed on the contents of the accumulator with the number that was keyed in acting as the second operand.
